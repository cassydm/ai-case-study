## Overview and Origin

modl.ai is a Danish company co-founded in 2018 by Benedikte Mikkelsen, Lars Henriksen, Sebastian Risi, Julian Togelius, Georgios N. Yannakakis, and Christoffer Holmgård. CEO and Lead Engineer, Christoffer Holmgård, had spent much of his career in the gaming industry, having owned an indie games studio called Die Gute Fabrik. He also spent much of his time researching machine learning for games. Upon creating modl.ai, the group decided that AI was the next big opportunity for game development
modl.ai now boasts 34 employees as of 2023, and is continuing to grow, being one of the most promising AI companies in gaming. The team, composed of game developers, engineers, and AI experts, work together to give game developers better tools for building better games.

modl.ai provides game developers with bots or virtual players for numerous purposes, whether it be to test it or just to see if the game works. It also has the capacity for deploying AI driven NPC (non-player characters) into the game. modl.ai is big on using its technology for discovering bugs and glitches by mimicing real players and their playstiles. modl.ai's team is focused on how AI can create better games.

The company has two products: 
modl:play - _Virtual Players on Demand_
> Player bots that behave like humans, so that the game's players are matched with bots of a similar rank. 
modl:test - _Automated Game Testing_
> QA (quality assurance) bots who's task is handling the repetative aspects of game testing to find bugs or glitches, much like real players would. 

In 2022, modl.ai raised 8.5 million Euros in a series A funding. 

## Business Activities

modl.ai's main goal is to help game developers create better games by deploying AI to solve bugs and clitches and crashes, so the game developers can spend more time on sripts and graphics, etc. 

modl.ai's customer base is game developers. It is an industry that only continues to grow in saturation, considering now several of the big games out today were developed by groups of one!

There are numerous QA AI bot companies, especially with the rise of AI. What sets modl.ai apart is their team. All were either game developers previously and currently, or equally passionate about games. Their tool is very specific to game developers.

There is little information of specific technologies the team at modl.ai is using, however its clear that their tool utilizes quite a bit of Machine Learning and even Deep Learning to have developed their bots.

## Landscape

The company is in the AI field, but specific to game developers.

One thing about the gaming industry, is that every few years, a major box game such as Call of Duty or Pokemon, release their latest game. Often times, upon release, these games are expensive, only available on latest gen consoles, and riddled with bugs. For instance, upon release of the latest Pokemon game, Scarlet and Violet, players took to social media to complain about the lack of quality out of one of the biggest game development companies, Nintendo. Imagine if Nintendo had employed modl.ai QA bots to discover these bugs before the game was released. This would have allowed more time to develop the story and graphics to ensure a better gaming experience for gamers.
Additionally, the latest big thing in gaming is Unreal Engine 5. It is a tool for creators to develop very detailed games with ease. One issue with Unreal Engine 5, is that its so dependent of GPUs that it is unattainable for use in games with independent developers. In the next five-or-so years, most games will be developed with Unreal Engine, and due to its vastness, AI like modl.ai will become more and more nescessary to implement as the scope of gaming requirements (from audio to graphics) increases.

It is unclear the true scope of competition in modl.ai's field, especially considering that for years, game testing was done by real people, and it continues to be that way now. However, modl.ai was listed as one of the most promising AI companies in 2021.

## Results

modl.ai is relatively new, with a vritually untapped market. One of the games for Holmgård's game development company recently utiliezed its own technology in a published case study. On a small team, with only one person designated as QA, modl.ai was very nescessary. It is clear that modl.ai will be very important for smaller companies and single game developers in the near future. It's team is composed of well known software engineers, some even having previously worked for developers as large as Riot, so it is very possible modl.ai is being utilized behind the scenes of large developers.

The main success of modl.ai is not measured in "how fun is the game?" Instead it is measured in how much more can be developed now that QA is being streamlined?. Due to the limitations of reasearch with modl.ai, it is unclear the success, but it is clear from past case studies that the tool itself does work.

## Recommendations

It might be benificial for modl.ai to develop cheat detection bots. In today's competitive online gaming scope, cheaters run wild. And so modl.ai would have a huge bonus to its usability if it can not only test for bugs, but for players using cheats. 

This service could utilize its pre-existing its QA framework to detect players with unauthorized software, by seeing it as a bug, or by finding patterns in cheater's behavior through the tools they used to develop their AI QA software. 

These technologies are appropriate for detecting cheaters because cheaters use software, and often times, these use game code to reveal player locations in order to reveal player locations or "auto aim". The AI software at modl.ai could detect this behaviour as a bug or alternatively, learn it to be able to detect it, and ban those who use cheats.

## Conclusion

modl.ai is an extremely promising small company with AI technology to revolutionize the way developers make games.
